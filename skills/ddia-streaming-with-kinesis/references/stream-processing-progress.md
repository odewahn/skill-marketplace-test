## Study Log

### Session 1
**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Duration**: In progress
**Topics covered**:
- Introduction to streams (unbounded data concept)
- AWS Kinesis basics (partitioned logs)
- Hands-on: Created Kinesis stream, produced and consumed events
- Partition keys and sharding

**Key insights**:
- Streams are unbounded - no inherent end, unlike batch processing
- Partition keys determine which shard events go to
- Events within a shard maintain order

**Questions to research**:
- Why is partitioning important for ordering?
- How is streaming different from polling a database?
